        I'm a Computer Engineer and a Full Stack Developer, proficient in
        Typescript, React, Vue, Node, Python, Next, Nest, Jest/Vitest, SQL and
        NoSQL databases and others technologies/frameworks. I also have
        experience in Cloud Providers, especially AWS, and messaging using
        RabbitMQ. I've been coding for over 5 years, teaching myself along the
        way, very curious about everything related to the technologies that I
        like to work on. Currently I'm working with Next.js and Node using
        Serverless Architecture @ Altiverse. I've been studying more about the
        techs I use, focusing in software architectures, like microservices and
        design patterns.
